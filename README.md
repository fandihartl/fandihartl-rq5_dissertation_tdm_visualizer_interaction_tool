This repository contains tools and scripts for processing, analyzing, and visualizing interview data. It integrates with Neo4j and provides an interactive web interface using Dash.

## Features
- import and process data from multiple sources.
- visualize relationships and trends in the data.
- interactive web dashboard.

## Installation
1. clone the repository
2. navigate to the project directory
3. install dependencies 

### Packages configuration

1. Python3.8.x or higher required

## Usage

### Data import
To import the coded interview data to the Neo4J Aura database: 
1. use the Excel-file of the example coded interviews in ```.\TDebituM-master\Backend```
2. define the correct file path in ```.\TDebituM-master\Backend\data_import.py```
3. create an instance in [Neo4J Aura database](https://neo4j.com/product/auradb) and update the credentials in ```.\TDebituM-master\Backend\data_import.py``` at ```config.DATABASE_URL```
5. run ```.\TDebituM-master\Backend\data_import.py```
6. agree with "y" to overwrite the aura database
7. you can explore the imported TD data in [Neo4J Aura - explore](https://console-preview.neo4j.io/tools/explore)


### Data visualization
To run the plotly dash visualization locally
1. check the credentials on ```.\TDebituM-master\configuration.py```
2. run ```.\TDebituM-master\index.py``` to establish connection to database
3. run ```.\TDebituM-master\launch.py``` to start application
4. if the backend (Neo4j Aura) database is connected, Dash is running on [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/);
5. for authentication USER: ```abcde``` and PASSWORD: ```1234```
6. use ```Ctrl+C``` to end the application

### Deployment via Heroku
To deploy the application, the current project uses the Heroku platform
1. install ```Heroku CLI``` via [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/)
2. install ```git``` locally via [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. install the software gunicorn with ```pip install gunicorn```
